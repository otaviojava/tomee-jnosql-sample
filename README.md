# Apache TomEE MicroProfile


This project provides a starter kit for Apache TomEE Eclipse MicroProfile projects hosted on Platform.sh.  It includes a minimalist application skeleton that is intended for you to use as a starting point and modify for your own needs, along with the Platform.sh Config Reader to simplify accessing Platform.sh environment variables.

Apache TomEE is the Eclipse MicroProfile  implementation that uses several Apache Project flavors such as Apache Tomcat, Apache OpenWebBeans and so on.
